`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Creator)`

I am an independent full-stack developer who enjoys learning new technologies and implementing them into my creations.  I am also currently a student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.  My coding projects are created from the ground up, which includes planning, development, and debugging.
